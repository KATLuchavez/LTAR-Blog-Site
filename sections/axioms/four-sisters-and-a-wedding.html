    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The film revolves around the four Salazar Sisters who reunite for their younger
    brother’s wedding. However, the sisters are on a quest to dissuade their baby brother CJ
    from marrying his fiancée, as they disapprove of the prideful and haughty remarks from the
    fiancée’s family thrown towards their humble home. As the story progresses, the Salazars
    confront their hidden deep insecurities, issues, and conflicts that they have yet to resolve
    within their own home.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Common in most families, typically with siblings, it is not easy to get along with each
    other’s decisions. This leads to some misunderstandings and cold shoulders when one
    sibling’s decision is questionable, especially if it concerns their life and future. In one
    particular scene, CJ walks out on his family when his sisters start to comment on his
    fiancée's looks, calling her chararat, which is a household expression that translates to ugly.
    When the sisters notice CJ’s absence at the dinner table, they see him sitting on the swing
    outside. This type of behavior from CJ dominantly expresses Axiom 1 of Communication
    which states: One cannot not communicate.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With CJ’s silent treatment coupled with his glaring, the sisters know something is
    wrong despite CJ not telling them. In fact, at the swing, CJ only gives them a look that
    sends a message to each sister to apologize for what they said about his fiancée. Therefore,
    even in CJ’s best efforts to avoid his sisters, the sisters have already come to their own
    conclusions of what CJ wants to communicate regarding his feelings about the situation.</p>

    <p><em>By: Michelle Beatrice J. Po and Erika Anne C. Tumulak</em></p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The movie Four Sisters and A Wedding is a drama-comedy about family relationships.
    The four sisters, hearing about the wedding of their younger brother, reunite to dissuade their
    younger brother from marrying his fiancé (whom they don’t approve of). In the midst of their
    plans to sabotage the wedding, the family, instead are forced by circumstances to face their
    own shortcomings and misunderstandings.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Axiom 3: The Nature of a Relationship Depends on How Both Parties Punctuate the
    Communication Sequence is displayed. Over the course of the movie it is shown that they
    have numerous (not so) hidden complaints about each other and in this scene it’s all splayed
    out. Their relationship amongst each other (particularly amongst the sisters) is full of
    complications because of all the times a family member has done something or said
    something, the others would internally interpret it in a way that causes them to react
    negatively, or putting labels and having assumptions on certain behaviors caused by the
    siblings as well as their mother. This doesn’t only apply to them as a family, but even the way
    they react to the fiancé of their brother (as well as the fiancé’s family). This is all explicitly
    shown in the scene at the peak climax of the movie where they finally shed all pretense and
    have a heart-to-heart talk about all their hurt and misunderstandings over the years amongst
    themselves. Bea, one of the four sisters, had been hurt all these years, feeling somewhat
    neglected and loved less (stating that her mother has favorites) due to the numerous
    instances where her mother seemingly prioritizes her sibling, Teddie, over her, no matter the
    achievements she seemed to showcase and all the sacrifices she had to make for the
    betterment of her siblings. She specifies instances where she gets scolded for eating food
    despite her being hungry, simply because it was meant for the “favorite child”, and not getting
    praised for the numerous medals she had received in favor of praising Teddie instead despite
    only getting one medal. Meanwhile Teddie (and the sisters) always had her pegged as
    arrogant and cold due to her strong facade, whilst the mother never once thought about
    “favorites” as she stated, “In my heart, I loved you all the same.”</p>
