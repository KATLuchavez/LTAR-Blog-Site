    <p><em>By: Klyle Alexandre T. Luchavez and Felix Miguel D. Arranguez</em></p>

    <br>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ben and his newly engaged girlfriend, Jen, had plans to go Iceland for their
    prenuptial video, but find their relationship tested in ways they’ve never experienced before.
    The couple frequently fought during their vacation and ultimately decided to break up due to
    Jen acting like a different person. 3 years later, Ben is now happily engaged to someone
    else. Their paths cross once again and Ben discovers that Jen already had a brain tumor
    during their vacation. They talk about what happened between them and Ben felt guilty for
    the times he hadn’t been patient with her. Ben accompanied Jen through her final days as
    her condition got worse and her eventual passing.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In our chosen scene, the couple are walking home after Ben proposes to Jen and she
    said yes. During their walk, they talk about their wedding, eventually migrating to New
    York, and Jen wanting to take the Bar Exam again. Their communication exudes seemingly
    harsh and lewd content, albeit delivered in a playful manner. This type of communication
    works and is acceptable only for very close relationships, such as romantic relationships. In
    any other type of relationship, the things they said may be seen as mean and offensive.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The dominant axiom present in the scene is axiom 2, which states that every
    communication has a content and relationship aspect. The content of a sender’s message
    should depend on the type of relationship he/she has with the receiver. For proper
    communication to occur, the content must match the existing relationship of the involved
    parties.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When Jen mentions wanting to take the Bar Exam, Ben replies “Para saan? Babagsak
    ka naman ulit”. If they were mere acquaintances or they weren’t very close, Ben’s reply
    might have been taken by Jen as demeaning.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Continuing their conversation, Jen jokes about Ben not loving her because he doesn’t
    express his support for her taking the Bar Exam, to which Ben replies “Alam mo, kung hindi
    kita mahal, hindi ko ibibigay yung gusto mo na itigil natin yung pagse-sex natin...Christian
    ka, sabi mo...hindi tayo pwedeng magsex...tiniis ko kahit mahirap magpigil”. Other people
    might hear that and think Ben might be manipulating Jen with ulterior motives. But, being a
    long-time couple, they both understand that it was meant to be a joke and the two just
    laugh it off.</p>
