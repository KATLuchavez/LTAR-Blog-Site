    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Gifted is a local movie released last September 03, 2014, which was directed by
    Chris Martinez starring Cristine Reyes as Aica Tabayoyong, Anne Curtis as Zoe Tuazon, and
    Sam Milby as Mark Ferrer. The movie revolved around the story of two best friends since
    childhood who are both gifted with intellectual capabilities beyond average yet were not
    blessed with physical attributes appealing to what was standardized by the society. They
    eventually became bittersweet rivals for the newly transferred student, Mark Ferrer.
    Thereafter, Zoe and Aica go through cosmetic surgery and become beautiful vixens engaged
    in vicious confrontations in an attempt to outsmart and surpass each other.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Montes (2021) cited Watzlawick’s Axiom No. 5 which states that communication
    between human beings is either symmetric or complementary which is dependent on the
    partners' relationship whether it is based on differences or parity. In connection, this is
    relatable to what we are accustomed to with regards to being well mannered. Every Filipino's
    heart and mind is instilled with “respect for others”, especially for those who are older than
    us. Regardless of our generation or geographic area, we place a great value on this attribute.
    It has become an emblem of our culture in the Philippines (Shiho, 2017). A scene in the film
    depicted a situation similar to this, in which Anne Curtis' character, Zoe, addresses her religion
    teacher about her ideas on the biblical genesis of the universe. It all started with a simple
    laying out of viewpoints in which she opposed all of the teacher's explanations until the
    conversation turned heated, at which point Zoe responded to the teacher in a provocative
    manner, infringing the extremely essential trait – “respect”.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Moreover, it is observable that although Zoe disagreed with the idea taught by her
    teacher, she still did lower her voice while the nun started to raise hers. This shows that her
    teacher has a higher power / position than Zoe, dominating her idea while disregarding Zoe's.
    Furthermore, this was supported by the second part of the scene wherein Cristine Reyes’
    character, Aica, whose parents reminded her not to imitate what Zoe did, saying that it is
    wrong to talk back to elderly. This is hence an example of a complementary relationship.</p>
