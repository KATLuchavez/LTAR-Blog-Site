                  I came from a broken family with a younger sibling residing with my mother. “Organized”
                  is the word that best fits me. I often keep things in order which eventually became my
                  hobby. As an aspiring Civil Engineer, my goal is to have housing projects for the
                  homeless and contribute to creating a sustainable society, a sense of loyalty I have
                  as an ISFJ person.

    <h1 class="main-heading axioms-of-communication-heading color-DB324D-heading">Axioms of Communication</h1>
    <p class="axioms-of-communication-description">
    To understand the communication set of circumstances and interpret miscommunication
    before it develops, it is critical to understand the axioms of communication and how they affect
    the communication process. Paul Watzlawick, a philosopher and communications theorist,
    proposed five axioms of human communication in the 1960s, which serve as a framework for
    analyzing human interaction. Why is it important? These methods can help us not only get more
    knowledge, but also improve our communication,and interpersonal skills. The five axioms of
    communications are:</p>
    <ul class="axioms-list">
      <li>Axiom 1: One cannot not communicate</li>
      <li>Axiom 2: There are both content and relationship levels of communication</li>
      <li>Axiom 3: The nature of a relationship depends on how both parties punctuate the communication sequence</li>
      <li>Axiom 4: Communication can be both digital and analogical</li>
      <li>Axiom 5: All communication is either symmetrical or complementary</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="axioms-of-communication-description">
    To see the axioms in action, let's look at some scenes from different movies and
    analyze how different axioms were used in communication.

  <!-- Communication Style -->

  <section id="communication-style">
    <h1 class="main-heading content-padding color-DB324D-heading">Communication Styles</h1>
    <p class="content-padding description">
      There are a number of communication styles
      that have been studied and exhibited by people. However, the four (4) basic communication styles are the
      passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive, and assertive.
    </p>
    <p class="content-padding description">Assertive Style: people with this style are able to express their thoughts, emotions and needs clearly
    and honestly. They are aware of their own needs but also of the needs of other people and they try
    to compromise respectively. They treat both themselves and other people with respect when they
    communicate.
    </p>
    <p class="content-padding description">Passive Style: people with passive style avoid expressing their emotions and they often try to block
    their thoughts, emotions and wishes. They are doubtful that when doing so they will somehow
    trigger conflict or bad feelings between them and the people around them.
    </p>
    <p class="content-padding description">Aggressive Style: people with aggressive style tend to care about meeting their own needs and
    goals first, regardless of the needs of other people. They can be verbally aggressive when
    communicating with other people and they try to control the others. This leaves other people
    feeling intimidated, hurt or bitter.
    </p>
    <p class="content-padding description">Passive-Aggressive Style: people with passive-aggressive style tend to express their emotions,
    thoughts and needs in an indirect way, and they do not express their anger in a clear way. They
    can use sarcasm or the silent treatment. This can leave other people confused or feeling like they've
    been manipulated.

                  My predominant communication style is Passive-Aggressive.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  I often use this style to my family members and close friends. Especially when I'm angry, I am
                  quiet but I don't mock them. Towards my mom, I just do what she wants although it is not
                  always what I liked because I am afraid to disobey her. To my close friends, I don't really show
                  my emotions clearly and just do the silent treatment (if face-to-face).
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  Honestly, I know this is not an effective way of communicating to other people but I am afraid
                  to get rejected. Everytime I do this, I am misunderstood since I do not convey my emotions
                  directly. I don't know, but it's really hard to speak up and until now, I am trying my best to talk
                  more about what I feel and prioritize my self first before other people.

                <p class="description">
                  The people with whom I most often use this style are with my friends and family.
                  I'm just more comfortable around them, thus allowing me to express myself more freely
                  and easily. Also, along with that comfortability around them comes closeness, which
                  allows me to be more perceptive of their needs and thoughts, which allows me to
                  make better decisions that benefit us both.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  I believe my style of communication is quite effective as it allows me to express
                  myself clearly and, as a result, the people I'm communicating with are encouraged
                  to also express themselves clearly. Clear communication leads to better and healthier
                  relationships.

                <p class="description">
                  I am most often assertive with my mom, siblings, and my partner. Like in most families, conflicts
                  sometimes happen when there are opposing views. I find that I can express my thoughts and
                  emotions clearly to resolve these conflicts since my family is open to hearing each other’s views.
                  Moreover, with my partner, I am aware that we have different values and needs. Therefore, it is
                  important for both of us that we get what we want out of our relationship by communicating it
                  honestly instead of trying to read each other’s minds.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  I think being assertive has worked the best for me on most occasions. It allows me to balance caring
                  for other people’s needs with that of my own. I try to compromise with other people, and I feel content
                  with myself when I let other people know I see them for who they are. For me, I think the greatest
                  compliment I have received was when someone said they are themselves when they act around me.
                  It is important for me that people are respected for acting their truest selves, and in return, I am also
                  respected as a person.

                  My predominant communication style is Passive. I always dislike openly sharing my opinions most of
                  the time as I have had bad experiences with such events, and I have this unreasonable feeling of being
                  afraid that people will dislike me if I speak up about certain things.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  I use this style with everyone almost, really. I most use this style with people outside my closest
                  family members, such as friends, teachers, and strangers.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  I sometimes find that it works well when I sometimes only pitch in when my opinion is asked and only
                  if I am absolutely compelled to. Let's say we went out and people start discussing what restaurant
                  to go to and what to order. I am fairly fine with not conveying minimal inconveniences or whatnot.
                  However, let's say it affects my grades immensely and we are currently discussing how to go about
                  it and such, I'm fine with politely pointing out some stuff, but I try not to push my idea assertively
                  or aggressively. I think this style of communication has not really been extremely detrimental to me...
                  though there are times when bottling up emotions can be very stressful to me especially with school and
                  with what's happening right now. I find that keeping my opinions to myself allows for the most peace,
                  especially in the household.

                  When it comes to my mother and close friends, I am passive. Instead of facing them, I tend to
                  withdraw or distance myself from them when there is a dispute. It frustrates me because I know
                  they did something wrong and I want them to know about it, especially my mother. But I know
                  my mother well enough to know that if I tell her she's wrong, she'll respond as if she's writing a
                  two-page essay to defend her view, to the point of guilt-tripping me. In the case of my friends, I'd
                  rather not discuss it, but I'll make sure that I don't do anything with them that will frustrate me, or
                  that I don't make them do anything that would upset me.

                  In some circumstances, I don't believe this method of communicating is effective. It does, in some
                  ways, have pros and cons. Pro because I can avert a horrible disaster that would negatively impact
                  my relationship with that individual, but cons since it will happen over and over again because
                  they are unaware of their behavior. They were oblivious to the effect it has on me. That I'm in
                  pain, or even offended. For me to have an effective and healthy relationship with others, I will
                  work on enhancing my communication style.

    <p class="content-padding description">Fostering positive relationships between teachers and
      students can create classroom environments that are more conducive to learning. Students
      not only succeed academically, but teachers can guide them to be emotionally and mentally
      prepared for their future. Therefore, establishing boundaries between teachers and students

              Teachers and students, in my opinion, can be "friendly" in a respectful way, but they
              cannot be friends and should have boundaries and limitations on how they interact.
              This is part of the student-teacher relationship to have complementary communication,
              which means that one has more authority than the other (a teacher is of a higher position
              than that of the student) to also avoid biases within the class. As a result, they should
              not treat one another equally, as they do with their equal-status friends.

              I believe it is possible for teachers and students to be friends as long as they
              establish clear boundaries between their "professional" and "friends" selves. In
              the class setting, they should treat each other purely as teacher and student to
              avoid biases, while outside of the class setting, they can behave as friends.

              I think teachers and students can be friends as long as they act professional about
              it. Some teachers can be friendly and they can serve as mentors to students who are
              struggling in school. Being friendly to each other lightens the tension and encourages
              positive interaction, but it does not mean students disregard the teacher's authority.

              Yes, I think teachers and students can pursue a friendship as long as there are
              boundaries. To a certain extent there must be a separation of personal and professional
              relationship. I think having friendship between student and teacher is actually a good
              thing as it encourages a positive environment for learning, since it breeds a genuine
              care for one another and an eagerness to be of help and to learn from one another,
              rather than a cold hard professional line that is drawn which creatures a sense of odd
              pressure and distance wherein a student finds it hard to open up to the teacher, and
              the teacher may not even get through to the student at times because of this lack of
              sincerity on a personal level.

              We all have the right to be friends with anyone, of course. Even if you have a
              different status or position in life, you have the freedom to treat others kindly.
              Friendship, on the other hand, has several levels; He/she can be your friend to
              the point where you feel comfortable sharing a story with him/her, and you can be
              yourself while he/she is around. There's also a friend you talk to, but you're
              aware that you shouldn't disclose everything with him or her; you have so-called
              boundaries. This, I believe, incorporates the concept of a teacher-student
              friendship. You talk to them, we give our opinions, but we must remember that
              we cannot always share and express all of our feelings without valid reasoning.
              Let us keep in mind that they are still our teachers, and that mutual need and
              respect must continue to prevail.

    <p class="content-padding description types-of-relationships-description-frame">It’s because we share some kind of relation and bonding with all these people. Common interests, likes,
      dislikes, blood, bonding, and attraction are some factors that keep us glued to some people compared to
      others. As such, we establish relationships with many people, like family members, neighbors, cousins,
      partners, spouses, friends, and so on. Thus, the kind of love we receive from different relationships
      classifies them into different categories.</p>
